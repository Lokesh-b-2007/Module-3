# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
items=[1,2,-8]
s=0
for i in items:
    s+=i
print(s)
~~~
## Output
![445222212-9366939c-9934-40b3-958c-2c50479b2dee](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0ce011-224d-4ecc-8e9c-76b5a678f795)

## Result
Thus the program that calculates the sum of all elements in a list has been executed successfully.
