# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
t = ("s", 8, "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print(8 in t)
print('n' in t)
~~~
## Output
![445224090-40569614-98fe-4ca0-8fbc-78977b2bb71e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb3a75bc-59ee-4175-a0fa-f6b138b1e459)

## Result
Thus the program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple has been executed successfully.
